% The literature survey is a broad and shallow account of the field, which helps
% to place the contribution of the paper in context. It is part of the motivation
% of the paper, because it helps to identify the gap that this work is trying to
% fill, and explain why it is important to fill this gap. Rather than a list of
% disconnected accounts of other people's work, you should try to organise it
% into a story: What are the rival approaches? What are the drawbacks of each?
% How has !the battle between different approaches progressed? What are the major
% outstanding problems? (This is where you come in.)
